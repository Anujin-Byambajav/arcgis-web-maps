[This](https://csusb.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d03336a264cb4854ab9ee14aa8304eef) interactive web map displays the locations of earthquakes that have occurred around the world since 1970. The data for this map is sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake catalog, which is regularly updated to include the latest seismic events. 

Users can zoom in and out of the map to explore different regions of the world and click on individual earthquake locations to see more detailed information about each event, such as its name, magnitude, and date. The map also includes a time slider that enables users to visualize how earthquake activity has varied over the past several decades.

The earthquake data is symbolized using a simple renderer, to simply show where the earthquake happened over the years.
